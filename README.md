```

-   **`app/src/`**: The root of my application's source code.
    -   **`app/`**: Contains the main application component `App.jsx` and its styles `App.module.scss`, using CSS modules for style isolation.
    -   **`assets/`**: For storing static resources. Includes `icons/` for icons and `images/` for images.
    -   **`components/`**: Folder for React components. Divided into `common/` for shared components, `layout/` for layout components, and `index.js` for exporting components.
    -   **`context/`**: Uses React Context to manage global application state, with `index.js` serving as the aggregation point for contexts.
    -   **`helpers/`**: Contains helper functions and utilities in `index.js`.
    -   **`hooks/`**: Folder for custom React hooks, with `index.js` for their export.
    -   **`pages/`**: Contains page components that correspond to different routes in the application, with `index.js` exporting them.
    -   **`routes/`**: Defines application routing using `react-router-dom`, with `index.js` aggregating all routes.
    -   **`services/`**: For working with external APIs, includes `apiClient.js`, which typically uses `axios` for HTTP requests.

## Dependencies:

Dependencies are installed using `pnpm`.

-   **`axios`**: For simplifying HTTP requests to APIs.
-   **`date-fns`**: For working with dates.
-   **`react` and `react-dom`**: The foundation for developing with React.
-   **`react-router-dom`**: For organizing navigation within the application.
-   **`uuid`**: For generating unique identifiers when necessary.

## DevDependencies:

-   **`@types/react` and `@types/react-dom`**: TypeScript types for React, to ensure typing during development.
-   **`@vitejs/plugin-react`**: A plugin that integrates React with Vite.
-   **`eslint` and its plugins**: To ensure code quality and adherence to best practices for React development.
-   **`sass`**: Allows the use of SASS/SCSS for styles, providing enhanced capabilities compared to plain CSS.
-   **`vite`**: Chosen for its speed and ease of setup as a build tool for both development and production.
